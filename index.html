        A world cloud made with lyrics from Thank U, Next by Ariana Grande
        
        The Data Structure used to calculate the word frequencies was a HashMap, with the key being each individual lyric and its corresponding value the number of instances that the lyric appeared in the song.
        
        I chose this particular song because it was the first song I found on genius.com. It was number on a list of songs ergo it must be popular. 
        According to various news sources the song is about dealing with ex-lovers. This illicted responses from Ariana's past exes and specifically fellow celebrity Ricky Alvarez, the supposed subject of Ariana's song. 
    
        Given the recency of the song it has yet to be ranked on the billboard charts, however there have been speculation that Grande's song, following the track of many of her past songs, will top the charts. 
    
        The most frequent word were words of eponyomous to the song i.e. Thank, You, and Next. This is not a surprise.
