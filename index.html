        The Data Structure used to calculate the word frequencies was a HashMap, with the key being each individual lyric and its corresponding value the number of instances that the lyric appeared in the song. The HashMap data structure has the plus of not allowing duplicates to appear, therefore there was no need to write code to remove duplicates beforehand before creating entries into HashMap. HashMap naturally removed such duplicates in code as they were not valid, saving space and increasing efficiency. 
        
        I chose this song due to its popularity.
    
        Given the recency of the song it has yet to be ranked on the billboard charts, however there have been speculation that Grande's song, following the track of many of her past songs, will top the charts. 
    
        The most frequent word were words of eponyomous to the song i.e. Thank, You, and Next as appears in the lyrics and recorded by the iterator in the program to record its word frequency. This is not a surprise.
